Some python programs to help with quantum mechanics-related problems

***Fortuin-Kasteleyn Representation***: aka the random cluster model: a random graph that generalizes and unifies 
the Ising model, Potts model, and percolation model.

***Diffusion Monte Carlo***: a quantum Monte Carlo method that uses Green's function to solve the Schrödinger equation.

***Hartree-Fock***: a method of approximation for the determination of the wave function and the energy of a quantum many-body system in a stationary state.

***Lanczos Algorithm***:  iterative method that is an adaptation of power methods to find the m "most useful" (tending towards extreme highest/lowest) eigenvalues and eigenvectors of an nxn Hermitian matrix, where m is often but not necessarily much smaller than n.

***Local Density Approximation***: class of approximations to the exchange–correlation (XC) energy functional that depend solely upon the value of the electronic density at each point in space

***Slater Determinant***: expression that describes the wave function of a multi-fermionic system, satisfies anti-symmetry requirements and the Pauli principle by changing sign upon exchange of two electrons (or other fermions).

***t-J Model***: explain antiferromagnetic properties of the Mott insulators by taking into account experimental results about the strength of electron-electron repulsion in relevant materials.

***(Frank-)Wolfe Algorithm***: an iterative first-order optimization algorithm for constrained convex optimization.
